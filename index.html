						<span class="date">Introduction Techniques</span>
						<br>
						<span class="position">Sixer Theory</span>
						<p class="mt-4">The Sixer Theory consists of six essential points, with the first three focusing on the basic introduction and the next three enhancing employability prospects. 
							<ul>
								<li>Name – Start with your full name, spoken with confidence. A strong introduction begins with a clear and assertive mention of who you are.</li>
								<li>Place – Mention your hometown or current residence. This gives the listener an idea of your background.
								</li>
								<li>Education – List your academic qualifications in reverse chronological order (most recent first), 
									i.e., Graduation → 12th Grade → 10th Grade. This highlights your most relevant and recent education first.

								</li>
								<li>Recently Accomplished Work – This includes internships, research papers, projects, training/certifications, and workshops. 
									These experiences demonstrate your practical knowledge and willingness to upskill.</li>
								<li>Career Objective – A well-defined, short, and specific career goal that reflects your aspirations and professional direction.</li>
								<li>Hobby – Mention a personal interest that reflects your personality and skills, such as photography, blogging, or traveling. 
									Hobbies can serve as conversation starters and display additional competencies.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<br>
						<span class="position" color="white">Five Ring Theory</span>
						<p class="mt-4">The Five Ring Theory takes a slightly different approach, emphasizing interpersonal elements along with educational and professional details. 
							<ul>
								<li>Name – Begin with your full name, ensuring clarity and confidence in delivery.</li>
								<li>Place – Mention your city or hometown to provide background context.
								</li>
								<li>Education – Briefly outline your educational background in a structured manner.

								</li>
								<li>About Family – A unique addition in this approach, where you provide a brief mention of your family. 
									This helps in showcasing interpersonal skills like adaptability, teamwork, and values learned from family upbringing.</li>
								<li>Goal – Define both short-term (mission) and long-term (vision) career objectives.

									Short-term goals should align with your immediate career aspirations.
									
									Long-term goals should reflect your ultimate professional vision.</li>

						<span class="date">Movie Review</span>
						<h2>The Pursuit of Happyness</h2>
						
						
							<ul>
								<br>
								<span class="position"> Favorite Dialogue</span>
								<p>"You got a dream, you gotta protect it. 
									If people can't do something themselves, they're gonna tell you that you can't do it."</p>

									<p> Why it's powerful: This dialogue reveals a harsh truth about the world: people project their own limitations onto others. 
										It reminds us to stay determined and push forward regardless of negativity.</p>

								<br>
								<span class="position">Review of the Movie:</span>
								<p>The Pursuit of Happyness is more than just a movie; it's an inspiring story of hope, struggle, and victory. 
									It teaches us that success doesn't come easy, but with determination, patience, and hard work, anything is possible. 
									It's a must-watch for anyone looking for motivation, especially for those facing obstacles in their journey.</p>
									<br>
								<span class="position">Learning Taken from the Movie:</span>
								<li>Never Let Anyone Define Your Limits </li> 
								<p>People often impose their own fears and failures on others. 
									If you have a dream, don't let negativity stop you from pursuing it.</p>
								<li>Hard Work Pays Off</li>
								<p>Success doesn't come overnight. 
									Consistent hard work and dedication are essential to achieving your goals.</p>
								<li>Persistence is Key to Success</li>
								<p>o matter how many failures or rejections, pushing forward is essential.</p>

								<li>Believe in Yourself</li>
								<p>Believing in yourself helps you stay motivated and focused.
									Self-confidence and determination are crucial to overcoming obstacles.
								</p>
								<li>Happiness is a Journey, Not a Destination</li>
								<p>Life is about the pursuit of dreams, not just reaching the goal.</p>
								
								<li>Stay Positive Even in Difficult Times</li>
								<p>Staying positive in difficult times helps you maintain your motivation and focus. 
                                    It also fosters a sense of resilience and growth.</p>

						<span class="date">Learning Taken </span>
						<br>
						<span class="position"> Lecture 1</span>
						<p class="mt-4">Sir wants us to work hard and stay disciplined because our parents have put a lot of effort and money into our education. 
							He is strict because he wants us to do our best and be ready for the challenges of life. 
							He also teaches us to love ourselves, which helps us aim for success. Even though he pushes us, it's because he wants us to become strong and capable for the future. 
							His lessons remind us to be thankful for our parents and take responsibility for our own growth.
							
						</p>
						<br>
						<span class="position">Lecture 2</span>
						<p class="mt-4">In the second lecture, sir told us how important it is to stay confident during an interview. 
							He said we should believe in ourselves and our abilities. 
							He also advised us to think of the company we're applying to as if it's our own, showing care and responsibility. 
							This way, we can impress the interviewers and show them we're the right fit for the job. Confidence and a positive attitude can help us succeed! 
						</p>
						<br>
						<span class="position">Lecture 3</span>
						<p class="mt-4">It is crucial to maintain honesty during interviews, as validation checks are conducted to verify claims made by candidates. 
							Any false information can backfire and harm credibility.
							Apart from technical expertise, strong communication, adaptability, and interpersonal skills play a significant role in career growth and professional success.
							He also highlighted the importance of smart bluffing over reckless bluffing. 
							While minor exaggerations can sometimes help in presenting oneself confidently, outright falsehoods in resumes or interviews can be easily caught and damage one's reputation.	
						</p>
						<br>
						<span class="position">Lecture 4</span>
						<span class="position">- Sixer Theory</span>
						<p class="mt-4">The Sixer Theory is a structured approach to self-introduction, especially useful in interviews and formal interactions. 
							It consists of six key points. Start confidently with your name, followed by your place of origin or current residence to give context about your background. 
							Next, highlight your educational qualifications in reverse chronological order, beginning with the most recent degree to show relevance. 
							After that, mention your recent accomplishments such as internships, projects, certifications, or workshops that demonstrate hands-on experience and continuous learning. 
							Then, clearly state your career objective a brief and focused goal that reflects your professional aspirations. 
							Finally, share a hobby that reveals your personality or transferable skills, like writing, traveling, or gaming, which can also help build rapport.
						</p>
						<br>

						<span class="position">Lecture 5</span>
						<span class="position">- Five Ring Theory</span>
						<p class="mt-4">The Five Ring Theory offers a holistic self-introduction by blending personal and professional elements. Start with your name, spoken clearly and confidently, followed by your place—your city or hometown—for context. 
							Then, give a concise overview of your educational background in a logical order. A distinctive aspect of this theory is mentioning your family, which subtly highlights values, teamwork, and adaptability learned through upbringing. 
							Conclude by sharing your career goals—define both short-term (mission) and long-term (vision) objectives that reflect where you are headed professionally and what drives your ambition.
						</p>
						<br>
						<span class="position">Lecture 6</span>
						<span class="position">- Critical Thinking</span>
						<p class="mt-4">In this lecture, we explored strategies to effectively tackle situation-based questions, emphasizing the importance of understanding the scenario, analyzing it logically, and responding with clarity and objectivity. 
							The key takeaway was to avoid allowing personal emotions or practical biases to influence our judgment, thereby maintaining a rational approach to decision-making. We worked on a complex hypothetical situation set in a remote village of about 1,000 people, where a coal mine at the riverbank served as the primary source of livelihood. 
							A 75-year-old scientist, perceived as eccentric due to his ambitious energy research, was working in the mine despite battling a tumor. Alongside him were a young asthmatic lady conducting a survey, the mine’s owner, and a little boy. A routine blast at the site accidentally damaged the river wall, causing water to begin flooding the mine. 
							With panic ensuing among the workers, only one lift—capable of rescuing a single person at a time—was available, and the mine was expected to be fully submerged within 10 minutes, with each lift round taking 2 minutes. The challenge was to decide whom to save first, knowing not everyone could make it out in time. 
							Through this scenario, we analyzed different ethical and logical perspectives to arrive at the most balanced decision under pressure, understanding how critical thinking and prioritization play a role in crisis management.

						<span class="position">- Start of GD</span>
						<p class="mt-4">To begin a Group Discussion (GD) effectively, you can use several smart techniques to capture attention and set the stage. 
							Starting with a quote can instantly add depth, while giving a definition helps clarify the topic. 
							You might also ask a thought-provoking question to involve the group or use a shock statement to surprise and engage listeners. 
							Introducing facts and figures adds credibility, while a short story or personal anecdote can make your point relatable. Lastly, a general statement is a simple and safe way to begin smoothly. 
							Choose the method that best fits the topic and speak with confidence.

						<span class="position">Lecture 8</span>
						
						<p class="mt-4">In this lecture, we explored essential strategies to prepare for a personal interview. 
							Key points included researching the company and understanding the job role to tailor responses effectively. 
							We also emphasized the importance of knowing the interviewer, practicing commonly asked questions, and presenting oneself professionally through appropriate attire and a confident demeanor. 
							To make a strong first impression, candidates should be clear and composed in their communication. When addressing weaknesses, it’s best to mention traits that do not directly hinder job performance. 
							Overall, the lecture stressed the importance of self-belief—being authentic, confident, and never underestimating one’s potential during an interview.

								<p>A Group Discussion (GD) is a structured form of conversation where a group of individuals, usually between 6 to 12 participants, discuss a given topic for a set time. 
									This method is widely used in educational institutions and recruitment processes to assess various skills such as communication, teamwork, leadership, logical thinking, and subject knowledge. 
									GDs are meant to evaluate how well a candidate can express their ideas, engage in discussion respectfully, and collaborate with others. 
									The topics can range from factual and current affairs to abstract, case-based, or controversial subjects.</p>

								<p> In a group discussion, participants are observed on how effectively they present their points, counter others’ views with logic, and build upon others’ ideas while staying within the topic. 
									Initiating the discussion is often seen positively, provided the candidate makes a strong and relevant opening statement. 
									It is equally important to be a good listener and to allow others to speak. Maintaining eye contact, positive body language, and respectful gestures contribute to a good impression. Aggressiveness, domination, interrupting others, or staying silent can reflect poorly. 
									For example, in a GD on “Is AI a threat or opportunity?”, candidates should bring in balanced arguments using real-world examples and conclude with a neutral or optimistic outlook depending on the discussion flow.</p>

								<br>
								<p>Success in a GD requires preparation, awareness of current topics, and regular practice to improve articulation and confidence. 
									The key to standing out is being clear, composed, well-informed, and respectful of others’ viewpoints while making meaningful contributions.</p>

						<span class="date">Interview</span>
						
						
							
								<p>An interview is a formal interaction between an interviewer and a candidate aimed at assessing the candidate’s suitability for a specific role or opportunity. It is a crucial stage in any recruitment process and is designed to evaluate both technical and non-technical attributes of the applicant. 
									Interviews may be conducted in various formats, such as one-on-one, panel, technical, HR, telephonic, video, or group interviews. 
									Each format serves a different purpose but ultimately aims to test a candidate’s communication skills, subject knowledge, problem-solving ability, and personality traits.</p>

								<p> Typically, an interview begins with questions like “Tell me about yourself,” followed by deeper explorations into academic background, projects, internships, achievements, and domain knowledge. 
									For technical roles, candidates are expected to solve coding problems, explain core subjects like Operating Systems, DBMS, or Computer Networks, and describe their previous projects or work experience. 
									In HR interviews, the focus is more on behavioral questions such as strengths, weaknesses, challenges faced, and future goals. Confidence, clarity, honesty, and a positive attitude are essential to perform well. Body language, eye contact, and formal attire also influence the overall impression.</p>

								<br>
								<p>Preparation is vital before appearing for an interview. This includes researching the company, understanding the job role, reviewing your resume thoroughly, practicing mock interviews, and preparing for both technical and HR questions. 
									For instance, when asked to introduce yourself, a well-structured response might include your name, educational background, technical skills, past project work, and your goals. Avoid exaggeration, irrelevant details, or negative remarks about previous institutions or jobs. 
									A good interview showcases your abilities while reflecting your enthusiasm and readiness for the opportunity.</p>
